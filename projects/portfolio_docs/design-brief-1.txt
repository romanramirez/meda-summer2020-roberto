Design Brief


In this project we will be using a monochromatic color scheme to bring to life a minimalist design centered around Roberto Roman's FirstPrinciples design philosophy.

By using this minimalist approach we can highlight the important information, keep website response blazing fast, and we streamline prospective client's attention and decision to work with us.

The dominant hue(s) will be:

#FFFFFF for the background

#000000 for most text and titles, contrasting with the white.

#333333 for paragraph text to keep with monochromatic scheme and still be able to differentiate between header text and paragraphs.

From this site, I liked the clean, smooth, flat design. I like the way that there's symmetry to the page and an almost minimalist design. I really like the way the page adds a sense of zen and clarity. What I didn't like: I didn't like that the site was a bit too static, I would have liked there to be more interactivity or at least a few elegant animations, nothing big or too intense.

This page was one of my favorites. I like the modern take on design - communicated in part by the sans serif font styles and the Apple emoji-like figure at the beginning of the page. What I didn't like: There was little not to like on this page, largely because there was little on the page to begin with but I would have liked to see a little more variation on the color scheme.

This page in particular was a good inspiration. I especially like the way it features samples of work and projects in a patchwork pattern throughout the page. It allows the visitor to see samples of different 'flavors' of work. I did not like the way the navigation opened up into a sidebar-type window. The background was too distracting. I think opening to a new page would look a bit cleaner.
