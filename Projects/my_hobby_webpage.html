    <h1>The Badass Art of Gardening</h1>

    <p>Hi there! My name is Roman and today I'll be showing you how to gain superpowers.</p>
    <p>Yeah, you heard right.</p> 
    
    <p><i><b>Superpowers.</i></b> &#x1F525;</p>

    <p>I'm going to show you how to wield ultraviolet radiation, water, and earth to clone and grow the most<br>
       luxurious of herbs: basil and mint. Don't have a green thumb? No worries. I got you. Even if <br>
       you've never had so much as a house plant, we're going to take you from complete noob to pro. <br>
       Or semi-pro, at least. Let's go!</p>

       
    <h2>Gardening is a superpower?</h2>

       <p>Yep. It is.<p>

       <p>There's something pretty awesome about being able to take three seemingly basic elements and <br>
       transforming them into something that you can eat, transforming them into something close to magic.<br>
       I first started getting into gardening because I was tired of buying expensive herbs to cook with.<br>
       $5.60 for a tiny sprig of thyme I'm only going to use once in a while? Yeahhh, no thanks. <br>
       Besides, I like to cook and as any chef worth their salt knows: the fresher the ingredients, the <br>
       better the dish! So I decided to start growing my own herb garden.</p>

       <h2>Where do I even start though?</h2>

       <p>Alright, so, this first step is up to you. <i>You</i> get to choose which plant you want to start with.<br>
        Will it be mint? The cool, fragrant, shade-lover? Or will it be basil? The sun-loving, equally-as-fragrant<br>
        Mediterranean beauty? Choose whichever you're more comfortable with; they're both quite forgiving<br>plants and you should choose whichever one is best suited to your climate.</p>

      <h3>1. Basil</h3>

      <p>Ok, so, first up is basil. A flowery, fragrant herb that makes almost any dish taste amazing. It's used in everything from pasta to pizza (<i>basically any dish with an Italian taste profile</i>) and it's also super easy to grow.<br>
      Below is a plant 'pokedex' to help break things down:</p>

      <p><b>Basil Basics</b></p>

      <p>Basil loves: &#x1F44D;</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Warm sunny weather!</i><br>If temperatures frost bring your plant inside.</li><br>

        <li><i>Being too crowded!</i><br>
          Give your plant adequate space as not enough air can cause mildew to grow on your basil.</li><br>
        <li><i>Ants</i><br>
        These bastards will eat your basil and leave the leaves looking like swiss cheese.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Basil hates: &#x1F44E;</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>The cold!</i><br>If temperatures tend to frost where you live, bring your plant inside.</li><br>
        <li><i>Being too crowded!</i><br>
          Give your plant adequate space as not enough air can cause mildew to grow on your basil.</li><br>
        <li><i>Ants</i><br>
        These bastards will eat your basil and leave the leaves looking like swiss cheese.</li>
      </ul>

        <br>

      <h3>2. Mint</h3>

      <p>Ah, so you chose mint, the shade lover. A crisp, fresh, fragrant herb that adds a cool note of elegance to any cocktail (<i>gimlets, anyone?</i>).  It's used in everything from pasta to pizza (basically any dish with an Italian taste profile) and it's also super easy to grow.<br></p>

      <p><b>Mint Basics</b></p>
      
      <p>Mint loves: &#x1F44D;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cool shady weather.</li>
        <li>Lots of water.</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>A</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mint hates: &#x1F44E;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hot warm weather.</li>
        <li>Ants! Just like basil, they tend to eat the mint.</li>
        <li>Other plants! Mint is aggressive.</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
