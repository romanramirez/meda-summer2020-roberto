    <h1>The Badass Art of Gardening</h1>

    <p>Hi there! My name is Roman and today I'll be showing you how to gain superpowers.</p>
    <p>Yeah, you heard right.</p> 
    
    <p><i><b>Superpowers.</i></b> &#x1F525;</p>

    <p>I'm going to show you how to wield ultraviolet radiation, water, and earth to clone and grow the most<br>
       luxurious of herbs: basil and mint. Don't have a green thumb? No worries. I got you. Even if <br>
       you've never had so much as a house plant, we're going to take you from complete noob to pro. <br>
       Or semi-pro, at least. Let's go!</p>

    <h2>Gardening is a superpower? </h2>

       <p>Yep. It is.<p>

       <p>There's something pretty awesome about being able to take three seemingly basic elements and <br>
       transforming them into something that you can eat, transforming them into something close to magic.<br>
       I first started getting into gardening because I was tired of buying expensive herbs to cook with.<br>
       $5.60 for a tiny sprig of thyme I'm only going to use once in a while? Yeahhh, no thanks. <br>
       Besides, I like to cook and as any chef worth their salt <i>(badum psst!)</i> the fresher the ingredients, the <br>
       better the dish! So I decided to start growing my own herb garden.</p>

       <h2>Where do I even start though? &#x1F937;</h2>

       <p>Alright, so, this first step is up to you. <i>You</i> get to choose which plant you want to start with.<br>
        Will it be mint? The cool, fragrant, shade-lover? Or will it be basil? The sun-loving, equally-as-fragrant<br>
        Mediterranean beauty? Choose whichever you're more comfortable with; they're both quite forgiving<br>plants and you should choose whichever one is best suited to your climate.</p>

      <h2>1. Basil</h3>

      <p>Ok, so, first up is basil. A flowery, fragrant herb that makes almost any dish taste amazing.<br>
        It's used in everything from pasta to pizza (<i>basically any dish with an Italian taste profile</i>)<br>
        and it's also super easy to grow. Below is a plant 'pokedex' to help break things down:</p>

      <p><b>Basil Basics</b></p>

      <p>Basil loves: &#x1F44D;</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Warm sunny weather!</i><br>If temperatures frost bring your plant inside.</li><br>

        <li><i>Tomatoes!</i><br>
          Growing next to tomatoes may help your basil grow better.</li><br>
        <li><i>Water!</i><br>
        Basil loves water but be careful to only water the base of the plant as perpetually wet leaves are prone to disease.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Basil hates: &#x1F44E;</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>The cold!</i><br>If temperatures tend to frost where you live, bring your plant inside.</li><br>
        <li><i>Being too crowded!</i><br>
          Give your plant adequate space as not enough air can cause mildew to grow on your basil.</li><br>
        <li><i>Ants</i><br>
        These bastards will eat your basil and leave the leaves looking like swiss cheese.</li>
      </ul>

        <br>

      <h2>2. Mint</h2>

      <p>Ah, so you chose mint, the shade lover. A crisp, fresh, fragrant herb that adds a cool<br>
        note of elegance to any cocktail (<i>gimlets, anyone?</i>) and  pairs well with deserts too!<br>
        Plant your mint in loose, loamy potting soil and water adequately. Place in a cool, shady, spot out of direct sunlight.</p>

      <p><b>Mint Basics</b></p>
      
      <p>Mint loves: &#x1F44D;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>The cold!</i><br>If temperatures tend to frost where you live, bring your plant inside.</li><br>
        <li><i>Water!</i><br>
          Give your plant enough water as one hot day without adequate irrigation could cause your mint to die.</li><br>
      </ul>
    
      <p>Mint hates: &#x1F44E;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Hot weather!</i><br>If temperatures tend to be really hot and dry where you live, consider moving your mint to the shade.</li><br>
        <li><i>Being too crowded!</i><br>
          Mint tends to be invasive so keep it in it's own container. It needs room to g r o w and will take over an area if you let it!</li><br>
        <li><i>Ants! ...Again!</i><br>
            Ants love eating basil <i>and</i> mint. Watch for little holes in the leaves for signs of an ant invasion.</li>
      </ul>

       <h2>Top Tips &#x2B50;</h2>
       <p>As mentioned before there are challenges and threats for every gardener!

         <br>

        From ants to mildew, <i>-you-</i> are the guardian of your garden. Below are some helpful tips to help overcome them!</p>

       <p><b>Ants</b></p>
        <p>Ants are annoying.<br>
          They come, help themselves to your herbs, they leave. It sucks. Watch for holes in your leaves like the ones in the picture below.

        <br>

          If your plants are being taken over by ants, consider adding beneficial insects to your garden like a praying mantis or ladybugs.</p>

       <br>

       <p><b>Garden Layout</b></p>
       <p>Be a pro gardener by being mindful of your garden's layout.<br>
          Place plants that are sensitive to heat and sun in the shade, and plants that require full sun out in a sunny area facing south.</p>

       <br>
       <br>

       <p><b>Fertilizer + Mulching</b></p>
       <p>A master gardener's secret? Fertilizing and mulching.<br>
        While it may not seem that important, it is. Adding fertilizer helps keep your plants healthy and vibrant. Adding mulch helps retain moisture and saves water!</p>
